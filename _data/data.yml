    summary: |
        I am a Biologist working at <a href="https://www.ufv.br" target="_blank"> Federal University of Vicosa (UFV) </a>.
        My work involves providing support on analysis of biological data using bioinformatics. Most of supported research
        projects are related to molecular phylogenetics, microbial genomics and metagenomics. I am also a Research Associate
        at <a href="https://www.ridesaufv.com.br/" target="_blank">Sugarcane Breeding Program </a> at UFV, working in
        collaboration with other breeding programs of the university. My research is centered on un reveal the genomic
        complexity of sugarcane and its relation with agronomic traits.

        <br>My master's degree research was centered on epidemiology and evolution of Porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2).
        PCV-2 is a virus associated with a number of different syndromes in pigs known as Porcine Circovirus Associated
        Diseases (PCVAD). Since its identification and characterization in the early 1990s, PCV-2 has achieved a worldwide
        distribution, becoming endemic in most pig-producing countries, and is still considered as an important cause of
        losses on pig farms. By using molecular phylogenetics and phylogeography approaches, my research found correlations 
        among the genealogy of PCV-2 isolates and its geographical distribution with the live pig trading statistics 
        available at United Nations Comtrade Database, highlighting the importance of the movement of animals around
        the world in the emergence of new pathogens, and showing the need for effective sanitary barriers when trading
        live animals.

      <br>My bachelor degree research was centered on characterization of Porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2) genome using
      bioinformatic approaches. Despite its very compact circular genome containing 1,768 nt, PCV2 has several Open
      Reading Frames (ORFs) that had not been characterized at the time of my research. Therefore, my bachelor's
      monograph was foccused on prediction and annotation of hypotheticall ORFs of PCV-2 genome.
