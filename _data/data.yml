        <br>My doctorate's degree research was centered on analysis of the nuclear, chloroplastidial and mitochondrial genomes of sugarcane cultivar RB867515. This sugarcane cultivar was released by Sugarcane Breeding Program of UFV and stands out due to its good productivity in sandy and low fertility soils, being among the most planted sugarcane clones in Brazil.

        <br>My master's degree research was centered on epidemiology and evolution of Porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2). PCV-2 is a virus associated with a number of different syndromes in pigs known as Porcine Circovirus Associated Diseases (PCVAD). Since its identification and characterization in the early 1990s, PCV-2 has achieved a worldwide distribution, becoming endemic in most pig-producing countries, and is still considered as an important cause of losses on pig farms. By using molecular phylogenetics and phylogeography approaches, my research found correlations among the genealogy of PCV-2 isolates and its geographical distribution with the live pig trading statistics available at United Nations Comtrade Database, highlighting the importance of the movement of animals around the world in the emergence of new pathogens, and showing the need for effective sanitary barriers when trading live animals.

        <br>My bachelor's degree research was centered on characterization of Porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2) genome using bioinformatic approaches. Despite its very compact circular genome containing 1,768 nt, PCV2 has several Open Reading Frames (ORFs) that had not been characterized at the time of my research. Therefore, my bachelor's monograph was foccused on prediction and annotation of hypotheticall ORFs of PCV-2 genome.

        tagline: "<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2014113855A1/en" target="_blank">WO2014113855A1</a> - The present invention relates to the preparation of the recombinant antigen of the viral capsid of Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) and modifications thereof, by expression in a prokaryotic system, purification in the monomer form, recovery of virus-like particles (VLPs) and their use in vaccine formulations, diagnostic kits and a system for quantifying in vaccine lots the PCV-2 antigen by means of a capture ELISA assay. The antigens and vaccine formulations can be used for immunizing animals in programs for combatting PCV-2-associated diseases in conventional swine breeding systems, and represent alternatives to the commercially available vaccines. The ELISA kit can be used for testing the quality of commercial and/or experimental vaccines against PCV-2.A responsive website template designed to help startups promote, market and sell their products."
